# ChicagoFox

ChicagoFox is a theme for Firefox that transforms the browser by giving it a style similar to that of earlier Windows versions. 

Also works well with Chicago95: https://github.com/grassmunk/Chicago95

## Installation 

To install ChicagoFox, you must first enable theming. To do this, navigate to your profile folder. In your URL bar enter ```about:config``` and type in ```toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets``` and set it to true.

Once you have enabled theming within Firefox, you may go to ```about:support``` and open your default profile folder. Within your default profile folder you want to drag and drop the chrome folder into it.

To enable the custom start page you want to navigate to Firefox Settings and under the "Home" section you want to set "Home Page and New Windows" to the directory of the Start Page HTML file.

And voila! ðŸ¥³
